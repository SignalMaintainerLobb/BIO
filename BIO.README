“A lot of what shaped my work habits came from the railroad—
there’s no margin for sloppiness when lives and logistics depend on your signal being right. 
I handled hundreds of real-world issues under time pressure, on-call. 
That kind of environment teaches you to work precisely, work fast, and stay calm even when the system’s down. 
It’s stuck with me since.”
